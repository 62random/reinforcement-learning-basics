# reinforcement-learning-basics

TLDR:
* Basic demonstration an comparison of Q-Learning and SARSA
* Small repo I intend to use as a basic cheat-sheet for OpenAI Gym projects (or even any similar Reinforcement Learning problem)

Q-Learning and SARSA are two of the most popular Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.

I had to compare them while solving a simple problem, following [this medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-implement-grid-world-from-scratch-c5963765ebff), for a college assignment.

I decided to leave this repo as a mini-guide for whenever I want to revisit this subject and play around introducing some minor changes or maybe completely different algorithms.


I structured this small project in a way similar to [OpenAI Gym's API](https://gym.openai.com/docs/), so I can also use this repository as a basic cheat-sheet for when I am working with framework.
